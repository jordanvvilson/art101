			<h1>Challenge</h1>
			<p>The challenge was to work with doms and mess around with elements.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I wasn't really sure where to start. I had forgotten what elements were at my disposal, but w3 schools and some help from Chat Gpt completley expanded my project. </p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I mean, here it is.</p>
