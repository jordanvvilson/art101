					<p>The challenge was to create a function in Javascript. I ended up creating a pop up box asking the user to enter their name.</p>

					<h2>Problems </h2>
					<p>Linking wasn't much of an issue, especially with the guides but I'm still struggling make another function. I've asked some other students for help, but will ask again in section or class tomorrow.</p>
